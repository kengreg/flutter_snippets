# FLUTTER SNIPPETS - HOW TO FETCH DATA FROM JSON REMOTE FILE

This is a small example of how to fetch or get data just like ajax but using flutter/dart.
Its a little bit more complated since even if you json decode you need also to map the data again and then give value types, create models, etc...
I tried to explain some parts in the file but it will be good if someone expert can explain better.
Also added a json example with the structure used for this.
