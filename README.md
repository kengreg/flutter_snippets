# FLUTTER SNIPPETS

A collection of small snippets of code to remember and use in different projects.
Flutter is a good tool but many times we need to memorize code which is repeated many times. Since the documentation is lack in examples for specific troubles and it is complicated and tired to look for answers always in Stackflow I will put this repository public for any who wants to share.

Please if you see any good way to improve each snippets or if you have any good to add to the collection let me know.

Remember all the codes are without any guarantees for future updates of Flutter/dart.
